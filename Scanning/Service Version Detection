Service Version Detection
Nmap has a database named nmap-services that contain more than 2200 well-known services.
- nmap –sV <target IP>

OS Fingerprintingnmap
Nmap has a huge OS fingerprinting database with more than 2600 OS fingerprints
– O <Target Address>
– osscan-limit - which would limit the detection to a few, more promising targets.
– osscan-guess - which detects in a better and more aggressive manner.
- nmap –n –A –T5 <target IP> - perform both OS and service version detection

POF stands for passive OS fingerprinting. As the name suggests, it does not directly engage with the target while performing 
OS fingerprinting; it monitors and tries to identify the TCP stack, and based on the TCP stack type, it figures out the type of OS.

Output:
◾ Normal Format - nmap –sS –PN <targetIP> –oN rafay.txt
◾ Greppable Format - nmap –sS 192.168.15.1 –oG rafay
◾ XML Format - nmap –sS 192.168.15.1 –oX <filename>
