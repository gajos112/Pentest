Network Penetration Test
In a network penetration test, you would be testing a network environment for potential security 
vulnerabilities and threats. This test is divided into two categories: external and internal penetration tests.
An external penetration test would involve testing the public IP addresses, whereas in an internal test, you can become part of an 
internal network and test that network. You may be provided VPN access to the network or would have to physically go to the work 
environment for the penetration test depending upon the engagement rules that were defined prior to conducting the test.


Web Application Penetration Test
Web application penetration test is very common nowadays, since your application hosts critical 
data such as credit card numbers, usernames, and passwords; therefore this type of penetration test 
has become more common than the network penetration test.


Mobile Application Penetration Test
The  mobile  application  penetration  test  is  the  newest  type  of  penetration  test  that  has  become  common  since  almost 
every  organization  uses  Android-  and  iOS-based  mobile  applications to provide  services  to  its  customers.  Therefore,  
organizations  want  to  make  sure  that  their  mobile applications  are  secure  enough  for  users  to  rely  on  when 
providing  personal  information  when using such applications.


Social Engineering Penetration Test
A social engineering penetration test can be part of a network penetration test. In a social engineering penetration test the 
organization may ask you to attack its users. This is where you use speared phishing attacks and browser exploits to trick a user 
into doing things they did not intend to do.


Physical Penetration Test
A physical penetration test is what you would rarely be doing in your career as a penetration tester. In a physical penetration 
test, you would be asked to walk into the organizationâ€™s building physically and test physical security controls such as locks and 
RFID mechanisms
