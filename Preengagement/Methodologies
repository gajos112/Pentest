---------------------------------------OSSTMM Open-source security testing methodology manual-------------------------------

1. OSSTMM Open-source security testing methodology manual basically includes almost all the steps involved in a penetration test. 
The methodology employed for penetration test is concise yet it’s a cumbersome process which makes it difficult to implement it in 
our everyday life.

concise - zwięzły
cumbersome - niewygodny

------------------------------------------------------------------NIST------------------------------------------------------

2. NIST, on the other hand, is more comprehensive than OSSTMM, and it’s something that you would be able to apply on a daily basis
and in short engagements.

Planning -> Discovery -> Attack (repeat Discovery) -> Reporting

Attack phase:
- Gaining access
Enough data have been gathered in the discovery phase to make an informed attempt to access the target

- Escalating privileges
If only user level access was obtained in the last step, the tester  will now seek  to gain complet control of the system
(administrator-level access)

- System browsing
The information gathering process begins again to identify mechanisms to gain access to additional systems

- Install additional tools
Additional penetration testing tools are installed to gain additional information or access or a combination of both

------------------------------------------------------------------OWASP------------------------------------------------------

3. OWASP Open Web Application Security Project 
The OWASP testing guide basically contains almost everything that you would test a web application for. The methodology is 
comprehensive and is designed by some of the best web application security researchers.
