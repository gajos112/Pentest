Every  penetration  test  you  do  would  comprise  of  a  rules  of  engagement,  which  basically  defines  
how a penetration test would be laid out, what methodology would be used, the start and end dates, 
the milestones, the goals of the penetration test, the liabilities and responsibilities, etc. All of them 
have to be mutually agreed upon by both the customer and the representative before the penetration test is started.
Following are important requirements that are present in almost every ROE:
◾ A proper “permission to hack” and a “nondisclosure” agreement should be signed by both 
the parties.
◾ The scope of the engagement and what part of the organization must be tested.
◾ The project duration including both the start and the end date.
◾ The methodology to be used for conducting a penetration test.
◾ The goals of a penetration test.
◾ The  allowed  and  disallowed  techniques,  whether  denial-of-service  testing  should  be  performed or not.
◾ The liabilities and responsibilities, which are decided ahead of time. As a penetration tester 
you might break into something that should not be accessible, causing a denial of service; 
also,  you  might  access  sensitive  information  such  as  credit  cards.  Therefore,  the  liabilities  
should be defined prior to the engagement.
